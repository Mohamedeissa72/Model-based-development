****Hysteresis current controller 
Speed controller calculates the difference between 
the reference speed (ω_ref) and the actual speed (ω)producing an error, which is fed to the PI controller.
PI controllers are used widely for motion control systems. An incremental encoder is used as a position sensor. 
The dynamic d q modeling is used for the study of motor during transient and steady state. It is done 
by converting the dqo variables to three phase 
currents by using inverse Parks transformation.
****PMSM Drive System
In the PMSM, excitation flux is set-up by magnets; subsequently no magnetizing current is needed from the supply.
This easily enables the application of the flux orientation mechanism by forcing the d_axis component of the stator current 
vector (id*) to be zero. As a result, the electromagnetic torque will be directly 
proportional to the q_axis component of the stator current vector (iq*) hence better dynamic performance is obtained by controlling 
the electromagnetic torque separately.
A system configuration of a vectorcontrolled 
PMSM drive system in the vector control scheme, torque control can be carried out by suitable regulation of the stator 
current vector; this implies that accurate speed control depends on how well the current vector is regulated. In highperformance vector drives, 
a currentcontrol loop, with a considerably high bandwidth, is necessary to ensure accurate current tracking, to shorten the transient period as much as 
possible and to force the voltage source inverter (VSI) to equivalently act as a current source amplifier within the current loop bandwidth. In this 
work, a hysteresisband current controlled VSI is used. To achieve a regular switching frequency and low harmonic content in the stator currents,
a band hysteresis current controller is used.This controller will generate the reference currents with the inverter within a range which is fixed by the width of the band gap.
In this controller thedesired current of a given phase (ia*,ib*ic*) is summed with the negative of the measured current (ia*,ib*,ic*). 
The error is fed to a comparator having a hysteresis band. When the error crosses the lower limit of the hysteresis band, the upper switch of the 
inverter leg is turned on. But when the current attempts to become less than the upper reference band, the bottom switch is turned on. 

#Conculsion
The proposed field oriented vector controlled PMSM drive can handle the effects of step change 
in reference speed and parameter variations. The overall system performances are quite good in 
terms of dynamic, transient and steadystate responses. Simulation and experimental results show that the 
proposed control scheme guarantees stable and robust response of the PMSM drive, under a wide range of operating conditions. Subsequently, it can 
be utilized in high performance motion control applications.
